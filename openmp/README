NOTE: All C files should have read permissions, All Bash files should 
have read and execute permissions

Type "make" to compile all files
Type "make clean" to delete all object files and executables

Q. 17.2

Solutions are in pragma.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. 17.8 - Monte Carlo method for approximation of value of Pi

There are 2 files namely : pi.c and pi.sh
pi.c contains the actual code which implements the Monte Carlo method

To compile pi.c - 
Type "make pi"

To run pi-
Type "./pi <number of samples> <number of threads>"

pi.sh is a bash script which automatically compiles pi.c and executes 
it for different values of samples and threads.

To run pi.sh-
Type "./pi.sh"

The result shows the count of coordinates inside the circle, the number 
of samples, and the percentage error in the value of Pi.

Q. 17.10 - Sieve of Eratosthenes

There are 2 files namely : sieve.c and sieve.sh
sieve.c contains the actual code which implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes
in both serial and parallel modes

Type "make sieve"
Type "./sieve <max num> <num threads>"

sieve.sh is a bash script which automatically compiles sieve.c and executes 
it for different values of num and threads.

Type "./sieve.sh"

The result shows the max num, num of threads and speedup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. 17.12 - Matrix vector multiplication

There are 2 files namely : matvec.c and matvec.sh
matvec.c contains the actual code which implements the Matrix vector mul
in both serial and parallel modes

Type "make matvec"
Type "./matvec <rows> <cols> <threads>"

matvec.sh is a bash script which automatically compiles matvec.c and executes 
it for different dimensions of matrix and number of threads.

Type "./matvec.sh"

The result shows the num of rows in the vector, num of threads and speedup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. 17.13 - Gaussian Method with backward elimination

There are 2 files namely : gauss.c and gauss.sh
gauss.c contains the actual code which implements the Gaussian method for
solving system of linear equations using pivoting and backward elimination.

Type "make gauss"
Type "./gauss <num vars> <num threads>"

gauss.sh is a bash script which automatically compiles gauss.c and executes 
it for different number of variables in the system of linear equations and
number of threads.

Type "./gauss.sh"

The result shows the number of variables, num of threads and time
taken to execute in seconds.
