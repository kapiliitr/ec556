Q. 17.2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. 17.8 - Monte Carlo method for approximation of value of Pi

There are 2 files namely : pi.c and pi.sh
pi.c contains the actual code which implements the Monte Carlo method

To compile pi.c - 
Type "make pi"

To run pi-
Type "./pi <number of samples> <number of threads>"

pi.sh is a bash script which automatically compiles pi.c and executes it 
for different values of samples and threads.

To run pi.sh-
Type "./pi.sh"

The result shows the count of coordinates inside the circle, the number of
samples, and the percentage error in the value of Pi.

Q. 17.10 - Sieve of Eratosthenes

There are 2 files namely : sieve.c and sieve.sh
sieve.c contains the actual code which implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes
in both serial and parallel modes

Type "make sieve"
Type "./sieve <max num> <num threads>"

sieve.sh is a bash script which automatically compiles sieve.c and executes it 
for different values of num and threads.

Type "./sieve.sh"

The result shows the max num, num of threads and speedup.
