Solution to Problem 17.2

a. #pragma omp parallel for

b. The total number of iterations is not known beforehand. 
   So, it cannot be parallelized.

c. It depends on the implementation of the function foo(). 
   If it does not have any undesired effects-
   #pragma omp parallel for 

d. Same as (c). It depends on the implementation of the function 
   foo(). If it does not have any undesired effects-
   #pragma omp parallel for 

e. Since the loop contains a break statement, it cannot be 
   parallelized

f. #pragma omp parallel for reduction (+:dotp)

g. i varies from k to 2*k => i-k varies from 0 to k. So, there 
   are no data dependencies.
   #pragma omp parallel for

h. i varies from k to n => i-k varies from 0 to n-k. If n>=2*k, 
   iterations become dependant on one another, so it cannot be 
   paralleized.
